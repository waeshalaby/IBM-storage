# IBM Storage Overview

## Block Storage  
Block storage is the fastest storage solution because it leverages **SSDs, NVMe technology, and optimized protocols** designed for **low latency and high performance**. These factors make it the **ideal choice for critical applications** that require **ultra-low latency and high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**.  

**IBM Solution:**  
IBM offers the **IBM FlashSystem**, a high-performance block storage solution with different tiers to meet various business needs.

## Object Storage  
Object storage is slower than block storage but offers key advantages that make it ideal for unstructured data.  

### ‚úÖ Why Object Storage?  
- **Lower Cost & High Scalability** ‚Äì Can handle massive amounts of data at a lower cost.  
- **Metadata for Searchability** ‚Äì Unlike block storage, metadata helps with organizing, searching, and retrieving files efficiently.  
- **Accessible via API** ‚Äì Object storage is cloud-friendly, accessible through HTTP(S) APIs (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage).  
- **Durable & Redundant** ‚Äì Multi-region replication ensures data is always available.  
- **Ideal for Unstructured Data** ‚Äì Great for logs, backups, media (images, videos), IoT data, and machine learning datasets.

## File Storage  
File storage is a **structured storage solution** where data is **organized in a hierarchical format using directories and files**, similar to a traditional filesystem. It is commonly accessed through **protocols like NFS (Network File System) and SMB (Server Message Block)**, making it ideal for **shared access across multiple users and applications**.

# Storage Tiers  

Storage tiers are categorized based on **performance, cost, and use case**. The reason **Tier 0 is super fast** while other tiers are slower comes down to the **underlying storage media, architecture, and access methods**.  

| **Storage Tier** | **HDD or Hybrid?** | **Storage Type** | **IOPS (Performance)** | **IBM FlashSystem Model** | **Use Case** |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Tier 0 (Ultra Performance)** | ‚ùå No | NVMe SSDs, DRAM, Optane | üöÄ 1,000,000+ IOPS | IBM FlashSystem 9500R | AI, high-frequency trading, critical DBs |
| **Tier 1 (Enterprise Performance)** | ‚ùå No | NVMe SSDs, Enterprise SSDs | ‚ö° 500,000+ IOPS | IBM FlashSystem 7300 | Databases, VMs, mission-critical apps |
| **Tier 2 (Balanced Performance)** | ‚úÖ Yes (Hybrid SSD + HDD) | SAS SSDs + Enterprise HDDs | ‚öñÔ∏è 50,000 ‚Äì 250,000 IOPS | IBM FlashSystem 5200 | File servers, mid-range workloads |
| **Tier 3 (Entry-Level)** | ‚úÖ Yes (Mostly HDD) | Large SAS/SATA HDDs | üê¢ 10,000 ‚Äì 50,000 IOPS | IBM FlashSystem 5000 | Backups, general-purpose storage |
| **Tier 4 (Cold Storage & Archival)** | ‚úÖ Yes (HDD, Tape) | Nearline HDDs, Tape Storage | üèîÔ∏è < 10,000 IOPS | IBM TS4500 (Tape Storage) | Long-term archival, compliance storage |
