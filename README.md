# IBM-storage
| Feature          | **Block Storage** | **File Storage** | **Object Storage** |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Structure**   | Fixed-size blocks | Files & folders | Objects with metadata |
| **Performance** | 🚀 High speed (low latency) | ⚡ Medium (depends on network) | 🔄 Scalable but not real-time |
| **Best For**    | Databases, VMs, high-speed applications | Shared files, documents, collaboration | Cloud storage, backups, AI, analytics |
| **Access**      | Low-level I/O via storage controllers | NFS, SMB (file-sharing protocols) | REST API (S3-compatible) |
| **Scalability** | Medium | Medium | 🌍 Very High (Petabyte-scale) |
| **Pros** | ✔ Fast & efficient <br> ✔ Best for databases & transactions <br> ✔ Reliable & consistent | ✔ Easy to use <br> ✔ Works with traditional apps <br> ✔ Good for shared access | ✔ Infinite scalability <br> ✔ Great for AI & analytics <br> ✔ Cost-effective for backups |
| **Cons** | ❌ Expensive for large-scale storage <br> ❌ No metadata (hard to search) <br> ❌ Not ideal for unstructured data | ❌ Slower than block storage <br> ❌ Hard to scale for big workloads | ❌ Not real-time (higher latency) <br> ❌ Needs API access (not traditional files) <br> ❌ Not great for databases |
